    <h4>Healthy body + healthy mind = ultimate lifestyle</h4>

    <div>
      <p>Learning any new skill is a key component of a happy and healthy lifestyle. When we talk to you about fitness
        and health, we're talking about many different aspects that reflect who a person is - from opting to take part
        in a great community and keeping active, to food preferences and making choices in general.</p>
      <p>An incredibly valuable tool in life is learning how to take control of your body and your mind in an
        unpredictable situation that you may find yourself in. </p>

      <p>When you have the skills to defend, and moreover, protect yourself; you are sure to feel calmer, more confident
        and empowered on the whole. So if a highly stressful situation were to arise, your self-protection skills and
        your confidence would see you through it.</p>

      <p>At UDA, we want to teach you to develop a broad awareness of your whole environment by using your logic and
        instincts. Being aware of your surroundings makes you more engaged. When you learn to do this with other people
        in a safe space, you're going to form some fantastic friendships. And you'll end up feeling more comfortable
        with yourself and the world around you.</p>

      <p>A healthy approach to fitness changes your entire life, and will see you living life to the fullest as you find
        your own balance between discipline, recreation and self-satisfaction. And we have no doubt, that when you
        pinpoint that: you'll be living the ultimate lifestyle.</p>
