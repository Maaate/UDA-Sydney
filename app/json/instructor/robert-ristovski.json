    "body": "<p>\"I've been at UDA since day dot,\" laughs Kru Robert, \"that was the day I started martial arts.\" With a long history at Ultimate Defence Academy, Robert's early years at the gym were marked by competing and winning State,  Australian and Pan Pac titles on the Jiu Jitsu circuit. But his real passion was Mixed Martial Arts, and soon enough he turned his attention to Muay Thai as the obvious next step to fulfill his MMA training.</p> <p>\"Thai Boxing is no doubt the most effective form of stand up,\" explains Robert, \"The first thing I teach my students is that it's not about aggression. You need to use your head, and strategise, and show technical superiority if you're going to win.\" This is the approach that has led Robert to win gold and silver at the Amateur MMA Championships in Sydney.</p> <p>At the same time, he's very content to divide his time between training and teaching. \"I enjoy seeing my students learn and evolve,\" says Robert, \"Seeing them achieve their goals is really rewarding.\" And that's a view that he practices before he preaches.</p> <p>\"I love having a goal to work towards,\" Robert reveals of his ongoing plans to compete in more MMA,  Thai Boxing and Kickboxing events, \"Leading up to a comp I feel really sharp and alive, and training in general is almost like therapy for me.\" Watch this space for his upcoming fight events.</p>"
