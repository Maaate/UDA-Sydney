    "body": "<p>Kru Jovan Stojanovski - the most experienced foreign fighter in Thailand. That title says it all. With 106 professional fights on Thai soil alone, Canadian-born legend Jovan has dedicated over a decade of living and training in Thailand to achieve such status.</p> <p>Today, this Muay Thai master spends much of his time travelling the world as an ambassador of the martial art, while continuing to fight professionally. \"It's a very respectful sport, and there are so many positive principles to benefit from,\" explains Jovan about what he loves most about Thai Boxing, \"You learn to discipline yourself physically and mentally.\"</p> <p>The results of Jovan's discipline and dedication to the martial art jump off the page of his resume. A highly decorated fighter, Jovan has had featured fights on all three major Thai television networks. He's faced off against legendary Olympic gold medalist Somrak Khamsing for the King's Birthday; which is a huge honour in Thailand. Then there's his incredible fight against Samkar Giat Monthep: 2001 Fighter of the Year at Lumpinee Stadium. Not to mention, his numerous contests at Ratchadamneon and Om-Noi stadiums.</p> <p>These accomplishments are all the more epic, when you realise that compared to Thai standards, Jovan is a late starter in the martial art. But to that comment, Jovan just smiles and says, \"well that just meant that I didn't have as much wear and tear as the other fellows.\" Touche.</p> <p>As a coach, Kru Jovan has trained many champions across Europe, Portugal, Thailand, Canada and in Australia, where he teaches frequently at his base Aussie gym: UDA.</p>"
