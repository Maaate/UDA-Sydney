    "body": "<p>A husband and father of three, Jason Awada was first introduced to Jiu Jitsu when his younger brother Wallid told him about Roots St George. \"I used to be pretty sceptical of all martial arts,\" laughs Jason at his initial hesitancy to try BJJ, \"and then I went to a class. By the end of it, I realised how wrong I was\". That was eight years ago.</p> <p>\"I've gained so many things from learning BJJ,\" swears Jason, also the Managing Director of a Sydney-based construction company, \"my fitness and wellbeing are fantastic, I've met some great people along the way,  and I enjoy every second of training.\"</p> <p>With a gold and two silvers to his name at the NSW Jiu Jitsu titles, Jason now says that he wants others to enjoy Jiu Jitsu as much as he has. \"It didn't take long until I got all three of my kids in to training,\" he says, \"It's something I want them to do for life. But really, it's something that's useful and fun for anyone and everyone.\"</p>"
