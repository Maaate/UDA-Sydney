My first introduction was a class taught by Paulo, after a friend talked me into checking it out due to its dominance of the UFC, we sat and watched as Prof. Paulo Guimaraes taught cross lapel chokes... next minute myself and my 2 friends who joined me are trying this new trick on each other as we walk back to the car. One week later we were signed up at Roots St George Under Prof Robert Naumoski and were instantly addicted! Ever since that day I have trained, competed, and travelled to Brazil to learn at some point I found that its not just a self defence or a sport but a way of life</p>"
