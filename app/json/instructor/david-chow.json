He held onto his gloves longer but 5 years later, when Prof. Paulo Guimaraes opened a gym close to his work, he took the opportunity to learn the ‘gentle art’ from the first BJJ black belt in Australia.  “It was an eye opener as my stand-up technics, conditioning and movements were essentially defenseless and it felt like I had to learn how to walk again in the world of martial arts.</p><p>He did learn how to ‘walk’ again by winning multiple NSW Summer/Winter/Spring champions along with 2nd place finishes in the NSW state titles.</p><p>Currently training under Prof. Robert Naumoski and the team at UDA Sydney, David enjoys the challenges and the competitiveness of the team. “For some odd reason, most guys at UDA are just bigger! Maybe it’s the water, but I also think it’s an excellent environment to develop your BJJ game and learn to use ‘leverage’ to counter the weight/strength differences.  The founding principles of why Grand Master Helio Gracie created BJJ.”</p>"
