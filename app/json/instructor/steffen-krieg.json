    "body": "<p>As a young adult, Steffen Krieg was competing at an elite level in the 100m and 200m sprints, with dreams of representing Australia at the Olympic Games. As a means to cross-train, he casually attended wrestling classes; and the road quickly led to Jiu Jitsu. \"It's an entire lifestyle for me,\" he says, explaining what Jiu Jitsu means to him, \"along with this lifestyle, comes the need to better myself consistently and then pass this knowledge onto others.\" </p> <p>Really humble for a guy who is the first ever Australian to win the World Pro Jiu Jitsu trials in Abu Dhabi. Not to mention, the four State Championships and three Australian Championships he won along the way.</p> <p>So what is it that drives him? \"There are many reasons why I continue with this martial art. For the most part, I love the sporting aspect of it. It's a passion I can't do without,\" Steffen explains, \"And I'm bound to the Roots team: our friendships are built on hard work, understanding and respect. That's what makes us a family.\"</p>"
