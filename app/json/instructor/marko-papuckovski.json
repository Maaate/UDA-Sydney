    "body": "<p>Marko's love for martial arts started like many other youngsters of the last few generations: obsessing over Bruce Lee movies. But when he added the fight event Pride to his viewing schedule, it kick-started his ambition to learn about the sensational art that is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. \"I started training at Roots BJJ as a young teen after I got my black belt in Tae Kwon Do,\" recalls Marko, \"and it's made me the person I am today\". We should probably break down what kind of person that is exactly.</p> <p>Three NSW Championships, an AMMA Welterweight Championship, an Australian Sambo Championship and two NSW Pankration Championships declare Marko as one of the fiercest and youngest BJJ/MMA competitors around. Talk about having a bright future.</p> <p>When he's not training, he's studying Nutrition Science at university, but still makes time to teach a class \"teaching Jiu Jitsu improves my Jiu Jitsu\" he reveals. \"I'm always surrounded by positive people like Prof. Robert Naumoski who take the extra time to sit you down and guide you in the right direction,\" smiles Marko, \"I love it here.\"</p>"
