    "body": "<p>A first meeting with two-time international titleholder, Phillipa Kato, reveals a woman with major plans for Australian Jiu Jitsu. \"I have a long-term dream to teach and attract more women and children into the Jiu Jitsu community,\" says Phillipa, \"In Jiu Jitsu, it's not about your size, it's not about your strength... it's about your skill. Trust me when I say, there isn't a better system for self-defence out there.\" </p> <p>Phillipa is the definitive ambassador for Australian Women's Jiu Jitsu. Her journey from girl-next-door to World Jiu Jitsu champion, and first female BJJ black belt in NSW is one of the most inspiring you'll ever hear about. \"I was working in hospitality when I started training BJJ,\" she recalls, \"I was 30, I had zero experience in martial arts, but I decided, then and there: I wanted to change my lifestyle.\" </p> <p>Soon after, Phillipa looked up Roots Jiu Jitsu, and started a serious training schedule under Prof. Paulo Guimaraes. After she took her first World title with only 16 months of training under her belt, the wins just kept coming: two NSW titles, four national titles in Wrestling and BJJ, Australian representative at the World Pro Jiu Jitsu trials in Abu Dhabi, and then another World Cup.</p> <p>Yet Phillipa is so down to earth and warm-spirited, you can't help but be encouraged when she says that with some hard work and planning, anyone can do it. \"I can promise you that Jiu Jitsu will improve your physical fitness, self-confidence and self-discipline,\" she smiles, \"I know this, because I've experienced it first hand.\" Well, you gotta trust that. </p>"
